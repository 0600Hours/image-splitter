# image-splitter
quick python tool to split images based on specific pixel values

scans vertically through an image for a specific hex value and splits the image at those points (inclusive)

wrote this in order to take an extremely long image of twitter replies and split them into individual screenshots of the replies based on the divider line

vaguely tested, feel free to take it and modify it for whatever you need
